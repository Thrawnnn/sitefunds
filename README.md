This addon lacks checks which require DarkRP or other libraries/frameworks which means it can be used on basically any gamemode or framework, enjoy!
( You can always add in your own :] )

This is an extremely simple and easy to read addon which adds in an entity, which depending on the amount of money, gives you different weapons, hp, and ap on use.
You can write a custom check in sh_functions.lua which should be pretty simple.

DISCLAIMER: You will likely want to edit the weapons you recieve in the init.lua file in the entities folder.
Requirements: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3125927292 and a Copy of Garry's Mod.

Thanks for downloading!
